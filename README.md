Originally I was working on this project on Swift programming language but I stucked in one point and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong and I left the project. 

Then I started learning web developement (from linkedIn Learning) and I remembered about this idea so here it is.  

The main idea for this project is to learn some foreign words from apps like for example duolingo or from reading books. Because when you learn a new word it disapears after few minutes, you have to repeat the words. 

Also nice thing is to add new words after learning from your memory. It shows you how little you can remember even seconds after learning. Add words and come back to them ass often as you want. 

Now this app is just for me but I will work on adding profiles so everyone can have own account and own words to repeat. 

Usage:

+ Learn new foreign word 
+ Learn new foreign word 
+ Learn new foreign word
