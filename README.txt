On this project I was working a lot. I was trying to do this in Swift language and it was pretty nice but doesn't worked like i wanted it to work and i couldnt figure out how to 
resolve all the problems - lack of knowladge. 

This project is working nice but of course I am going to work on that to make it perfect. 
I am using html, css, js, php, mysql in this project so i can also learn a lot.
